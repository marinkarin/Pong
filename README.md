# Pong
Building Pong from the [Godot Tutorial](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/learning/step_by_step/simple_2d_game.html "Godot 2D Tut")

As a bonus, I implemented a crappy looking title screen and a very simplistic scoring system.


## ToDo

- [x] Make a splash screen
- [x] Create a scoring system 
- [x] It works! 
- [ ] Sound effects?
